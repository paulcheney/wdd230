WEBVTT - English

1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:08.760
The Source image we'll be using today is

2
00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:13.019
a 'table setting' jpeg. It is 602 kilobytes

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.599
and it's currently 1678 by 1119 pixels

4
00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.619
wide, much too big to be using in our web

5
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.680
page.

6
00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.500
I have this online Pixlr E photo editor

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.840
up. It is a free tool. You're limited to a

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.160
certain number of saves per day so you

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.199
may have to spread out your work over

10
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.400
several days. Let's go ahead and start by

11
00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.560
opening...

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.960
our source image.

13
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.200
Now for this particular activity, we're

14
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.719
going to be using a 2:1 ratio so

15
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.219
grab the cropping tool,

16
00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.399
check the size. Our large image

17
00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.640
is going to be 1500 wide

18
00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.559
and half of that is 750 tall. Now we're

19
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.480
going to use art direction to select the

20
00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.520
part of this image we want to use for

21
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
the large screen.

22
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.360
I'm going to slide it up a little bit

23
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.800
so those glasses are centered.

24
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.559
Then I'm going to hit enter on the

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.540
keyboard. That crops it off. Notice the

26
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.659
width and the height over here.

27
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.619
I'm now ready to save that image.

28
00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.780
We will be using a web P, low quality

29
00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.000
at around 50%. That's going to give you

30
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.500
a really small image.

31
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.600
Let's save it as 'hero -'' and this will

32
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.119
be 'large'.

33
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.340
We'll save it out to the desktop.

34
00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.340
We can now return to our original image

35
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.860
by clicking up here on open.

36
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.340
Let's select the cropping tool again,

37
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.520
choose a size this time for medium screens.

38
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.659
We'll be using 1000 wide by 500 tall for

39
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.780
this activity.

40
00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.240
I'll change my cropping for the medium

41
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.060
screens. I'm going to focus more

42
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.340
on the glasses and the napkin, so I'll

43
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.320
put the glasses over here at the right.

44
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.740
This is 'Art Direction' to  focus

45
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.420
the user on what I want them to see.

46
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.399
Click enter on the keyboard.

47
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.540
Notice that the width and the height are

48
00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.280
correct.

49
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.700
Let's save it.

50
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.080
Once again we'll do web P, quality low

51
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.720
and hero

52
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.300
- medium.

53
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.140
Save it and we've got two done.

54
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.360
Let's now return to the open state,

55
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.720
grab the cropping tool,

56
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.500
size... and now for phones, or very small

57
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.480
screens, we'll be doing 500 wide by 250

58
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.760
tall.

59
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.840
This time I'm going to really focus

60
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.080
in

61
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.660
on this smallest glass and maybe this

62
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.760
Angel here in the napkin.

63
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.980
That'll be my Art Direction crop for

64
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.660
this one, Press enter.

65
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.519
Save.

66
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:53.480
We choosew low quality, save as hero

67
00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.480
- small

68
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.480
You now have in your desktop a series of

69
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.780
three images

70
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.040
each at a different width and height but

71
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.160
all using a two by one ratio. Each of

72
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.900
them saved at fifty percent quality. Look

73
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.159
at the size of these 37, 20, 8. If you

74
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.459
remember, our original image

75
00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:24.060
was just over 600 so we've done some

76
00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.780
amazing data savings by reducing the

77
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.920
size, choosing a webp format, and setting

78
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.920
the quality at low.
