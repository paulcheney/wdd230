00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.639
now we're ready to add a text overlay on

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.340
top of our hero image so inside the hero

3
00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.580
tag underneath the closing picture tag

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.619
let's go ahead and use a span tag

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.359
and I'll type Emerald Eve event center

6
00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.820
notice it displays immediately

7
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.840
underneath the photo now we need to jump

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.920
to our CSS dot hero

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.739
span this will allow us to style the

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.160
text so I can set the color

11
00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.399
to deep pink if I wanted

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.040
and you can see it's changed

13
00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.399
the text is currently below the image so

14
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.140
we need to make two changes to get it on

15
00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.899
top of the image first of all you need

16
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.940
to look to the parent element the span

17
00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.559
tag is a child of the division with a

18
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.539
Class of Hero

19
00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.039
so the first change we're going to make

20
00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.039
is to set the parent

21
00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.479
position to relative

22
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.420
and once we do that we can set the

23
00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.420
position of the child to Absolute

24
00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.740
you can see it's over here at the right

25
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.180
side that's not where we want it

26
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.320
so we're going to set the left Edge

27
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.240
at zero

28
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.000
that moves it over

29
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.619
we'll set the right Edge

30
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.540
also at zero

31
00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.100
so that means it will span the width of

32
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.560
the entire page

33
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.040
and we'll look at that here in a sec and

34
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.320
I'm going to align it to the bottom

35
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.259
at zero

36
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.860
let's set the background color

37
00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.960
equal to I'm going to use an rgba which

38
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.360
allows me to use an alpha

39
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.320
and let's use black which is zero zero

40
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.500
zero

41
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.500
and we'll use 50 black now you can see

42
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.960
that the span tag goes from the left 0

43
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.719
to the right zero and is at the bottom

44
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.080
when you look closely at it

45
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.599
you can see there's a little tiny Gap

46
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.459
where the black overlays the white below

47
00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.099
the pitcher that's because pictures by

48
00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.739
default are in line

49
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.780
so let's come up to the image and let's

50
00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.500
change it from inline

51
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.020
to display itself as a block

52
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.660
that solves that problem now if you were

53
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.760
to choose top zero

54
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.379
then you wouldn't have that problem to

55
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.760
deal with

56
00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.760
now if we want this text

57
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.459
to Center itself now you're going to use

58
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.260
text align

59
00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.000
Center

60
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.620
you've got it in the middle text align

61
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.420
right would move it here

62
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.700
if you wanted to push it away from the

63
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.879
edges then you'd throw some padding at

64
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.879
it

65
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.319
and we could change the color so it

66
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.120
looked better than deep pink the nice

67
00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.580
thing about this approach

68
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.560
is that that text stays at the bottom

69
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.900
and stretches

70
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.900
to match the image width
