WEBVTT - English

1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.060
Now let's work on the HTML for our hero

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.560
image. I'm going to lead off with a

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.940
division.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.620
This division is going to have a class

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.920
and I'm just going to make up the word

6
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.960
'hero' because it seems appropriate.

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.960
Inside that, we're going to have a

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.500
picture tag.

9
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.080
The picture tag is going to begin

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.560
with a source.

11
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.239
The source is going to have a source set

12
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.520
attribute.

13
00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.940
I'll fill that out in a second. It

14
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.660
also has a media query.

15
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.280
Inside here we're going to use a

16
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.200
max-width.

17
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.539
The width we'll use for this first

18
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.120
source is the width of our smallest

19
00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.660
image which you'll you will remember is

20
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.660
500 pixels.

21
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.539
The second source is just like the first

22
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.739
one except that the media query now

23
00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.100
matches the medium image width.

24
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.180
Now we're ready for a standard

25
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.740
image tag.

26
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.740
Images have sources.

27
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.520
In this particular case, the source is 

28
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.400
the large image.

29
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.720
It has an alt and I'll just call this

30
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.240
hero.

31
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.159
Then we're going to have a width

32
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.400
equals...

33
00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.080
and a height equals...

34
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.880
Then we'll finish it off.

35
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.500
So what should the width and height be

36
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.939
considering that we had three different

37
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.000
images,

38
00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.939
and three different widths and heights.

39
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.600
Well, actually since 2019 the width and

40
00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.520
height are a ratio they are not related

41
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.920
to the pixel width and height of the

42
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.200
source image so you could put any one of

43
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.180
the three combinations in here. Let's

44
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.700
go ahead and put 500

45
00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.140
and 250.

46
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.840
Or, we could just as easily do 50 by 25

47
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.600
that's still a two by one ratio.

48
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.360
I'm going to copy this path,

49
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.160
and I'll paste it up here, and change the

50
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.940
word 'large'

51
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.940
to 'small'

52
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.680
For the second one

53
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.319
we'll use 'medium'.

54
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.920
You can see over here is a very small

55
00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.920
preview...

56
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.560
Let me go ahead and use the larger values.

57
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.540
There we go, you can see a little bit better.

58
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.780
So there's this small one,

59
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.540
because our browser is narrower than a

60
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.800
maximum width of 500. Once we go a little

61
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.180
bit wider, it now jumps to the medium image.

62
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.959
What's happening here is it's actually

63
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.000
taking this source set path and it's

64
00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.900
replacing this srcset down here on line

65
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.739
17. When we get to medium it takes the

66
00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.440
medium srcset and uses that as the

67
00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.019
path for the image source.

68
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.140
So here we have the small image... 

69
00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.560
the medium image... and the large image.

70
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.080
Now it's not scaling with the page but

71
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.500
it is changing based on the width of my

72
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.500
browser.
