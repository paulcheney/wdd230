1
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.940
we'll start by talking to the hero

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.139
division

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.599
which has a child of pitcher

4
00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.540
we're going to set the width

5
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.520
of the picture tag which is the parent

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.380
to 100 percent

7
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.880
the next thing we're going to talk to is

8
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.279
the image that's inside so dot hero

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199
image

10
00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.019
and we're going to tell the image to be

11
00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.079
100 of its parent which is the picture

12
00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.520
tag now if we stop right there and we

13
00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.559
take a look at what we've got you can

14
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.500
see those glasses are being distorted

15
00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.200
this is a very common mistake what I see

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.260
from students is failing to set the

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.820
height at Auto or giving it a fixed

18
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.140
value so we're going to do it correctly

19
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.140
by setting the height

20
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.699
to automatic

21
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.860
now it's going to scale appropriately

22
00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.960
so there's the small version

23
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.220
there's the medium version

24
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.220
and there's the large version
