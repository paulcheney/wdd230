    <p>Student outreach includes any work you do to build relationships with students, help clarify course content and
      assignment expectations, and encourage students to persist and do their best in the class. Though some additional
      instruction may be given by week or course, student outreach assignments generally fall into the following
      categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-participating and Failing Students</strong> - In the initial weeks of a course, and at key times
        surrounding academic deadlines, you should reach out to students who are in danger of failing the course due to
        either low participation or failing grades. Message templates are provided in relevant weeks to assist you in
        reaching out to this student group.</li>
      <li><strong>Missing Assignments</strong> - Starting in Week 02, you should reach out to any students in your class
        who are missing high-stakes assessments. Specific assessments will be identified in your course-specific
        outreach tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>At-Risk Students</strong> - Some students may not be missing a high-stakes assessment, but they could
        use additional instructor help because they have received a lower grade on the assessment. Starting in Week 02,
        you will be asked to reach out to students who have scored low on a high-stakes assessment with an eye toward
        tutoring the student on specific concepts that could help them succeed. You may also allow students in this
        group to resubmit their assignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Positive Outreach</strong> - Part of good student outreach is not just focusing on students who may
        need additional help, but building relationships and presence with those who are already succeeding. Besides
        reaching out to students who are missing or scoring low on key assessments, you will also be prompted to reach
        out to students who have scored highly, recognizing their good work.</li>
      <li><strong>Additional Feedback on Course Content</strong> - Depending on the course, you may be asked to review
        certain assignments in order to give individual students or student groups additional feedback on key concepts
        so they can succeed in future assignments.</li>
      <li><strong>Inspired Outreach</strong> - As an instructor in your course, pray for your students. You may receive
        additional inspiration and guidance on other ways you can positively influence and encourage the students in
        your class.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="pop"><strong>Best Practice:</strong> When communicating with students one-on-one, use MS Teams. <br>When
      sending group outreach messages for assignment progress, use Canvas Gradebook.</p>


    <h3>Tracking Your Outreach</h3>
    <p>As you go about your weekly student outreach tasks, take care to not duplicate messages to students. Develop a
      method of tracking your outreach. Have ways to identify which students have received which messaging. Some
      instructors use the ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù column in the Gradebook to keep notes on their weekly communication with each student.
      Others use a Google spreadsheet or Excel. No matter what system you choose, find an approach that is both simple
      and effective for you.</p>
    <p>This course has been designed to better enable instructors to support and mentor students. The inclusion of
      certified graders in this course is to help you have more time to reach out and provide one-to-one student
      support. To learn more about the tools available to you and how you can be effective in this role, please refer
      back to the Student Outreach principles in your OL 110 WWB Instructor Certification course.</p>



    <p class="pop"><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Encourage students to meet with the course tutors and leverage search
      engines to accomplish difficult tasks.</p>

    <h2>Before Class Begins - <span id="sendWelcomeEmail"></span></h2>
    <h3>Send an Email</h3>
    <p>Modify the following message and then email it to all students using Canvas Inbox as well as posting it in the
      General MS Teams channel.</p>
    <div class="good">
      <p>What a fantastic opportunity to work with students from around the world who share a common faith.</p>
      <p>Class begins soon, and we must hit the ground running because we will cover the same essential learning
        outcomes in 7 weeks as in a 14-week semester.</p>
      <p>Canvas should be open now if you want to get started early. No Pressure here.üòÉ</p>
      <p>You need to dedicate many hours per week to master these concepts. If you don't have that kind of time, you may
        want to take the class later when you can devote enough time to be successful.</p>
      <p>You will be using VS Code to create all your assignments and then hosting them on GitHub. Both are tools used
        by professionals in the field. </p>
      <p>We will be using MS Teams for communication and teamwork, so ensure you have it installed and ready to go.</p>
      <p>It's going to be a fantastic and fast-paced ride for the next few weeks, so take your vitamin pills, and let's
        get started.
      <p>If you find yourself overwhelmed within the first week, you can drop the class using these instructions.</p>

    <h3>Connect Teams and Canvas</h3>
    <p>Open Canvas, select settings, click the "Intergrations" tab and activate Microsoft Sync. Click the "Sync Now"
      button. W A I T. </p>
      <img src="images/teams-integrations.webp">

    <h3>Add Channels to Teams for Groupwork</h3>
    <p>Add a new channel in MS teams that exactly matches the names of the People>WDD230Groups in canvas (takes about 10
      minutes)</p>
    <img src="images/channels.webp">
    <h3>Add channels for weekly discussions</h3>
    <p>Add a class channel for each week for class discussions "General Questions - Week 1" etc.</p>
    <img src="images/channels-general.webp">
    <h3>Post a message in Teams</h3>
    <p>Post a message NOT to use the General Channel. When we get over 100 people talking over 6 weeks, this becomes a mess.</p>
    <img src="images/teams-message.webp">
    <h3>Weekly Hints</h3>
    <p>If you have advice, tips, or hints for a specific week then post them to the General Questions for the related week. Hopefully this will encourage students to use these weekly channels for classwide communication.</p>
